// Desc is the descriptor used by every Prometheus Metric. It is essentially

// included in this package manage their Desc under the hood. Users only have to
// deal with Desc if they use advanced features like the ExpvarCollector or
// custom Collectors and Metrics.
//
// Descriptors registered with the same registry have to fulfill certain
// consistency and uniqueness criteria if they share the same fully-qualified
// name: They must have the same help string and the same label names (aka label
// dimensions) in each, constLabels and variableLabels, but they must differ in
// the values of the constLabels.
//
// Descriptors that share the same fully-qualified names and the same label
// values of their constLabels are considered equal.
