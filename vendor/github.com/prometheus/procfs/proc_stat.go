// Originally, this USER_HZ value was dynamically retrieved via a sysconf call
// which required cgo. However, that caused a lot of problems regarding
// cross-compilation. Alternatives such as running a binary to determine the
// value, or trying to derive it in some other way were all problematic.  After
// much research it was determined that USER_HZ is actually hardcoded to 100 on
// all Go-supported platforms as of the time of this writing. This is why we
// decided to hardcode it here as well. It is not impossible that there could
// be systems with exceptions, but they should be very exotic edge cases, and
// in that case, the worst outcome will be two misreported metrics.
