// `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:
//
//     paths: "f.a"
//     paths: "f.b.d"
//
// Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
// fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
// message in `f.b`.
//
// Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
// returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
// Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).
//
// # Field Masks in Projections
//
// When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
// sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
// specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
// example is applied to a response message as follows:
//
//     f {
//       a : 22
//       b {
//         d : 1
//         x : 2
//       }
//       y : 13
//     }
//     z: 8
//
// The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
// (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
// output):
//
//
//     f {
//       a : 22
//       b {
//         d : 1
//       }
//     }
//
// A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
// paths string.
//
// If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
// operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
// had been specified).
//
// Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
// top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
// field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
// list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
// in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
// other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
// clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
// any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
// behavior for APIs.
//
// # Field Masks in Update Operations
//
// A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
// targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
// to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
// and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
// describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
// fields not covered by the mask.
//
// If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, the existing
// repeated values in the target resource will be overwritten by the new values.
// Note that a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths`
