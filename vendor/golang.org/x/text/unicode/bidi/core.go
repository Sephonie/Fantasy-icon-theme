// This implementation is a port based on the reference implementation found at:
// http://www.unicode.org/Public/PROGRAMS/BidiReferenceJava/
//
// described in Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UAX #9).
//
// Input:
// There are two levels of input to the algorithm, since clients may prefer to
// supply some information from out-of-band sources rather than relying on the
// default behavior.
//
// - Bidi class array
// - Bidi class array, with externally supplied base line direction
//
// Output:
// Output is separated into several stages:
//
//  - levels array over entire paragraph
//  - reordering array over entire paragraph
//  - levels array over line
//  - reordering array over line
//
// Note that for conformance to the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm,
// implementations are only required to generate correct reordering and
// character directionality (odd or even levels) over a line. Generating
// identical level arrays over a line is not required. Bidi explicit format
// codes (LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO, PDF) and BN can be assigned arbitrary levels and
// positions as long as the rest of the input is properly reordered.
//
// As the algorithm is defined to operate on a single paragraph at a time, this
// implementation is written to handle single paragraphs. Thus rule P1 is
// presumed by this implementation-- the data provided to the implementation is
// assumed to be a sin
